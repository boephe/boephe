## Boephe
> ˈbiːfi<br>
I am a jill-of-all-trades IT nerd with a degree in Computer Science (and Games Technology) looking to specialise and build a career. I learn new applications and technologies quickly (like Markdown), and am passionate about seeing people get the most out of the technology available. I have completed the ITIL4 Foundation qualification and would love to grow in either IT Service Management or Software Development in a context where I can help non-technical staff create value (and reduce stress) through effective use of technology. This is most evident in my meticulous and easy-to-read documentation and communication when dealing with non-technical people.<br>
I've fiddled a lot with PowerShell and MS SQL and a little with JavaScript, Node.js, PHP, HTML and CSS. During my degree I primarily used C++ and C# with the MS XNA Framework, when it was shiny and new. I am confident I could dive into C# and .NET despite not using it for so long. I developed a solid Software Development foundation built on agile and object-oriented methods and thorough testing.<br>
